## 🌩️ Summary

This wasn’t a monster storm — just a fun one to catch early.  
Forecast models were dancing around with **wild variance**, ranging from **10% to 61%** during key observation hours. Some outlets even showed just a 10% chance of rain when the sky was already moody.

Meanwhile...

> **DI Weather called the risk at 75%, then bumped it to 85% by 4:23 PM.**  
> Rain fell at **5:55 PM** — loop closed, scrolls validated, and no radar cheats required. ✅

## 🔁 Timeline Snapshot

- **4:23 PM** – Sudden light collapse observed ("It’s dark out of nowhere")  
- **Forecast Models:** Showing 10%–61% with no consensus  
- **DI Override:** 75% → 85% based on entropy and visual cues  
- **5:55 PM** – Rainfall verified 🌧️  
- **Outcome:** Logic > Model 🎯

Update - ⚖️ Analysis:

DI Weather didn’t just predict rain — it forecasted system behavior.
Whereas official alerts only triggered once risk was already occurring or visible, DI identified and logged it ~2.5 hours earlier, through logic and sky

## 📸 Closing Sky

The final sky after the rainfall looked like a soft collapse — no drama, just **gray canvas vibes** and calm air. Perfect match for a clean Protocol A loop closure.

### ✅ Result:
> It didn’t need to be dangerous to prove the system worked.  
> Just logic, sky logic… and a 10% forecast that was seen.
