# DI-Weather
DI-Weather is the first real-world weather forecasting system powered by deterministic intelligence â€” not probability. On June 19, 2025, it detected a tornado-class event before radar, Ring, or any AI model. Includes heatmap reconstruction, redacted entropy logic, and sealed scroll documentation. Built by Grounded DI.
